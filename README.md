# Flourite Web!

This is a simple web presenting the usage of [Flourite](https://github.com/teknologi-umum/flourite), a library to detect a language using points system and regular expressions. I'd like to think that it's still a work in progress albeit the 100+ test cases already going on in there.

This repository is meant to be the playground for it, serving a basic Vue app on Vite. It's also the place for you to find any bugs, like a code is not detected as a certain programming language that you'd expect, and other bugs.

Enjoy!
